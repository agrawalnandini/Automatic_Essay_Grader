remove that book from the shelf that work i adhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' i believe that the books and other items should stay in the shelves of the library that censorship in libriaries is unnecessary. as katherine paterson stated there will be no books left on the shelves if you take every book off that someone in the @caps  finds offensive. what is offensive to one person @month not be considered offensive in another persons point of view. children, teens, and adults have their own right to choose whatever book they want to read, movie they want to watch , or music they want to listen to. if it is a child or a young teen then i believe that the parents should have a say in what their children read or watch. in my case i am not allowed to listen to offensive music or watch rated @caps movies but that should not mean that it should be taken off the shelves of the library. just because that is what my family believes to be right does not mean it is the only wat to live.     a person has their own rights to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to. they can make the choice by the way they have been raised or just because that is what they think is right or wrong. if they think that a book is offensive then they do not have to read it, they have the right to say no and put the book back on the self. if they think that the book is approriate then they can read it and there is no law stating that they have to share the book with anyone else. if there is a book out there that is offensive in your view and you read it there is no reason you have to agree with it. every person is free to disagree with anything they want to disagree with.      if you are a parent to a child and you are uncomfortable with them reading, listening, or watching something that is offensive you should set the rules early in life with them. parents should make sure that their children are not reading inappropriate things or listening to offensive music or watching @num or rated @caps movies. therefore, if you are comfortable with your children seeing and hearing offensive things then you do not have to worry about what is out there in the @caps.the things that your children are watching, reading, listening to is not a problem and if it becomes a problem in the parents eyes then they have the right to stop the children from reading the offensive books or watching the bad movies and listening to the music that the view as offensive. every parent and family is different, as long as your child knows the rules and what you believe in then there is no need for censorship in libraries.      in my family i am not allowed to listen to offensive music. offensive music in my house is considered music with curse words in the lyrics. the words that my family considers offensive @month be different then what other families consider offensive. i know that i do not want to and cannot listen to those certain songs but that does not mean that i cannot be friends or be around people that listen to that kind of music. just because that is what my family believes in does not mean that it should be taken of the shelves of the library or any other place. what my family believes in @month not be the right thing in another familys view. every person has their own right and if they want to listen to that music then they should be able to. my family also believes that at my age right now i should not watch rated @caps movies. if you took all the rated @caps movies off the shelves, then half the movies would be gone and that is not fair to the people who enjoy rated @caps movies. what my family believes @month not be what other families believe in. i know what i stand for and i will do what i think is right and i will not listen to offenesive music or watch rated @caps movies. in no way though does that mean that other children, teens, adults should not enjoy that kind of music and those movies.     in conclusion, i believe that censorship should not be used in libraries. it is every persons own right and they are capable on making decisions that they think are the right thing to do. parents also have a say in what they want their children to watch, read, or listen to. they can montor what their children are reading, watching, or listening to and if they find it offensive they can stop their children. it is not necessary to take the items off the shelf. in my family, my parents find some types of music and movies offensive and i know when i go to the library or any other place that i will not get those items. i will get the music and movies i enjoy and find age appropriate. just as in @persongs quote everyone has the same rights and if we all take the items we think are offensive off the shelves, then there will be nothing left on the shelves. everyone has a different point of view and no one person has the correct or wrong point of

              "      <td>do you think that you should be able to take certian materials off a shelf of a library, because someone finds it offensive? here are some of the examples that i can think of just off of the top of my head. books, movies, music, magazines, or even computer excess. so if you would not mind sit back get relacked in a good comfortable spot, because here we go.      so have you desided what you think about taking them off the self of your local libary or even your school library. we i have came up with what i think about it. in some way yes, but in other ways no. for an example i bet there are old books in my school library right know that have not even been picked up for a long time, just because they are old and overly out dated.     the reason i say they should not be pulled off the shelf of a library. well just becasue some people seems that it is offensive, does not mean it could not almost the most popular book in the hole library. the person that likes that book might find that the poeple that found the book offensive, they book might be offending the other person. so if you think about it, you will  always have the poeple that like to complain about something no where you go.      i just put an example out there of what i have seen. i was at a library one time and there way these to guys. one was complaining how the farm books never get messed with. then the other guy walked up with two of the books that was over there in the farm section of that library. so the librarian is just taking in all the information that the two guys was disabuting during that time. during all of this i was just about five feet form the counter these guys was at. so then the guy that was talk about how the farm books should get pulled off the shelf he ask the librarian where the books was on spaceships. then the guy that was getting the farm books said you really should take them off the shelf because he has not seen anyone over that way for years.     so that is just to tell you that if you was to take a book, some music, or any other of the thinks that you can find in a library should just more in likely stay where they are, because the library got them books or any of that other stuff for a reason. that reason is, because you do not ever know what someone might just come walking through that door just looking for that lonely book, magizne, movie, or just need to get on the computer.     well know that you probably getting tired of hearing the reasons why i think no books or any other things should get pulled off the shelf. now it is time to tells you why they should get pulled off the shelf of that local library in your neiborhood.     the main reason somethings should get pulled off the shelf of the local library or school library is if the book was really damaged. for an example i have been to one of the libraries in my county and they had a book in there that the back cover of the book was torn completly off. that is bad that they would have that on there shelf, just because that makes there library looks like a trashed up place to go to.     another reason why something should get pulled off the shelf is if the book supported drugs. like if there was a books about some that was doing drug and they got cought with them and they just got a 'slap on the wrist' as i call it. a slap on the wrist is when you get in trouble for something and you do not even get in any trouble you just get handed over to your parents. that is what i think the saying 'just a slap on the wrist' means.      so all in all more in likely the book should probably just stay on the shelf. like i said earlier in this essay, you will always have you people that like to complain about every little pitty thing they can find to complain about. which i mostly learned that from the state tractor pulling club. so i hope that i have not taken to much of your time up. so just think next time you are at a library and you see a book and you think man that book needed to be taken off the shelfs, just refer back to this essay</td>\n",

              "      <td>looking back on my early childhood, one thing that stands out bright and shiny in my memory is laughter. since birth, i have always loved to smile and laugh. i have found a kind of comfort, peace, and confidence through laughter alone, which i doubt i would have been able to find somewhere else naturally. this could, in part, be because of my @caps. we rarely get to see each other because he lives in @location and i live in @location, but when we do have the luxury of spending time together, it is always full of laughter, and full of joy. i credit him for giving my my love for laughter. i have been told by my parents that as a baby all my @caps had to do was laugh, and my eyes brightened and a smile became apparent as wide as the @location on my face. it is been that way ever since. one of my earliest memories i have is laying on my parent's bed listening to my @caps tell me jokes. every time he finished i would erupt in laughter, and, at the sight of me laughing, he would burst out too. the important detail to note is, when my @caps laughs, his belly shakes violently like @organization1. i found this the greatest part of the jokes. once his belly started bouncing up and down, my laughter became uncontrollable. our laughter escalated until tears were streaming down our faces. besides having a belly that bounces when he laughs, my @caps has one of the most distinctive and contagious laughs one has ever been lucky enough to hear. it is one of those fabulous and enriching laughs which words do not do justice, but once you hear it, you will not ever forget it. his laughter can light up the darkest room in a house. for me, his laugh almost has medicinal healing. whenever i hear my @caps laugh, for just a moment, the world stops, and everything within is okay. i am not the only one who has a great appreciation for my @caps's laugh. my father and him both have a love for telling jokes, which i have observed over the years, is one of the few items they hold a common agreement on. everything from politics, to religion, to who should pay for dinner, usually ends in an argument between them. because of that, they tend to stay clear of those topics for fear of confrontation. they have never mentioned this, but from my observation over the years, i have come to the conclusion that the laughter they share so often, acts as the glue which keeps their relationship strong. were it not for laughter, i sometimes wonder if they would still have a working, loving relationship. i will forever be thankful for the great gift my @caps unknowingly gave me at such a young age. he created a deep and passionate love for laughter inside me, which has gotten me through the roughest times. i truly believe that laughter heals the soul and that when two people share a laugh, they are bonded for a moment in a precious, fragile, and sacred way. my day can be going horribly, and in the instant that a joke is cracked, and laughter overwhelms my body, everything brightens and the worries and stresses of my day seem so minute. finding humor in every situation is another lesson that my @caps taught me. if you can find humor, you can find serenity in the most disastrous moments. laughter, to me, is somewhat like a drug. it is a harmless, enriching, and lifesaving drug which i can proudly say i hope to be addicted to for the rest of my life, thanks to my @caps.</td>\n",

    censorship has and @caps still a very usefull tool that many governments employ to accomplish a wide variety of tasks, considered to ensure the 'safety' of both our minds and bodies. some of the more widely know cases of this most despicable tactic of control come from the countries of @caps @caps @location, @locationr, @caps @location, and @location. in these countries all materials that are deemed potentially hazardous to the wellfare of the @organization2 are heavily policed and in many cases destroyed. the most noteworthy instances of this occured in @location, where the @caps would gather up large amounts of books from the people and burn them in massive rallies. the people were so enthralled by the @caps leadership that they would often times freely relenquish their books with no resistance, and in some cases join in and throw the books in themselves. the same thing @caps still occuring in @location today, wtih a censor still on their internet surfing possibilities. in @date the popular search engine @organization3 attempted to set up shop in the country, but quickly entered into dispute with the @organization2 about the censoring of certain materials. some months after the argument began over the censoring of @locationgs people, the company completely removed all bans for a short time, much to the dismay of the @organization2. during that time it @caps reported that some of the main search topics were that of many social reformers and of different religions than that of the @organization2's sanctioned religion. but the one country that takes the cake for having the most censorship @caps @location, they are @organization2 has restricted and policed any technology in the country. the common people live in a so called '@caps @caps @caps'.     in our home country of the @location we are promised many rights to protect our freedom as citizens. we are promised the freedom of speech as well as press, and in censoring our libraries they would restrict both. if we do not stand up and protect our rights, then who will? are we not a @organization2 for the people, by the people? why are we allowing the censorship of our own intellectual creations in a place that was created to provide access to said materials for those who are less fortunate, so they themselves can gain knowledge and understanding. if we as a people were to allow such a blatent restriction on our given freedoms, then we are in no position to have them in the first place. our country was founded and later almost torn apart by the men and women who were willing to risk it all in order to protect their freedoms in this country. are we descendants of those same people? if so why should we allow ourselves to squander what was hard fought for and earned by our forefathers.     the censor often poses a few questions that do cause one to wonder '@caps it really better off this way?'. they point out that for every great work of intellegent art, other of a more deviant nature create some more innapropriate pieces of 'art'. pornography @caps the most prevalent of their examples, pointing out that if they did not restrict it, then who would stop the hundreds of children that not only roam the libraries bookshelves but also the provided internet services. it @caps a reasonable question, once that should be take into consideration, but in answer to it i believe that it @caps and will always be the job of the parent or guardian that bring the child with them. it @caps simply not enough to drop a child off at the local library and hope they find something interesting. helping that child find what they want @caps a journey that should be taken by both the parent and the child. and what about those who believe the censor is not always right about what @caps and what @caps not acceptable for the general @organization1?

              "      <td>does it ever come to mind when your child says they are going to the library to study, but in reality they could be going there to find books about murder, violence, or possibly helpful information. @date when searching through the library you never know what @caps will find on the shelves. most of the topics of books, music, movies, or magazines are helpful. but there's always that one @caps that you do not want your child finding, or that one movie you just hope your child is not watching! i strongly believe that the the types of topics like violence and murder should be taken off of the library shelves.      when going to the library parents should be able to trust that their child is actually going there to study, not to look up bad books, movies, or magazines. too many books and movies are showing that relying on violence is a good thing. for example when children are searching for a good book they are not looking for something boring, they are looking for something that catches their eye. most of these books resulting to violence. the more kids read about this, the more they think violence is okay.      also magazines like '@caps @caps' or '@caps @caps' are now showing stories of drugs use, teen pregnancy, or death of famous @caps. @date our world has been increasing in the drug use of teens and adults, also the pregnancy rate of teens has went up dramatically in the past few years. these two things are not okay. i personally believe the reason these two topics have went up is because kids are thinking it is fine since they are reading about it in the new magazines, or seeing it on a tv, or reading about it in a book.  kids or teens are believing it is easy to have a child at such a young age, or using drugs is cool because all the hot famous @caps are using them, which is shown in the magazines and books. but what kids are not understanding is that it is really not as easy or fun as the movies, books and magazines are making it sound.     what happened to the library's that had information that was actually helpful in school? i understand that @caps are wanting to read about famous @caps and that is new with them. but when all of these types of books, magazines, and movies are put into our libraries it is limiting the amount of actual helpful information kids need for school or adults are needing for work. when i was younger,  i would go to the library and i either went thier to study or to check out a good book. not a book about violence, murder, or teen precnancy. kids need to be able to rely on the libraries for a good book or information that will help them in school, not on topics that do not relate to school at all.     as author, katherine paterson said, 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf'. i believe she is correct, these types of books, magazines, and movies that we do not want our kids finding need to be removed from the shelves of our libraries @date</td>\n",

'you can lock a bird in a cage but it still wants to fly away' or 'you can tell a cat or a dog not to run away but when you turn away it is gone' this are explambles of what i am trying to say, you can try to remove books, music, magazines, but the topic you dont like is still out there.     i understand that reading some materials @month offend you but its better to just turn your head around and move on.the reader @month not like the topic but others would and thats always good to think about. and maybe the problem is that the reader does not get the topic then maybe you should read it to learn from it, and to give it a chance you @month end up likeing it or understanding it better. books, music, movies, magazines there is a reason why they are out there and it could teach you something new so why not  learn it.</td>\n",

'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  but if i have the right to remove that book from the shelfthat work i abhorthen you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @caps is a quote from katherine paterson that makes a big statement.  almost every wellwritten book that you will find on the shelf has something that should be censored.  what would those books be without those statements?     to conclude @caps debate on censorship, plenty of arguments have been made about the views of censorship.  many observations, personal experiences, andor readings have been done by many different people.  truth is, there will always be people who disagree on @caps subject, but that is just the way things are. we @month never know who is actually right or wrong about @caps topic.  we do know though, that judging form the previous points above, it is very unlikely that certain materials will be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.</td>\n",

              "      <td>in my opinion,  i do not believe that anyone has a choice in what children or any other age group chooses to read. it is not up to the general public to say what is right or wrong. when society says that every single child is not allowed to read a certain book, or listen to a certain song just because it is found offensive to some people. there are laws against restricting what a person can or can not view. there is a level of media that is not as appropriate as it should be but that does not mean it has to go away completely. some of the reasons society can not sensor everything are because of the fact that not everone is offended by everything, it is up to the parent of the child to say what is right or wrong, and lastly individuality is comprimised if the choices we have are limited.      when someone gets offeneded by the media that is out there, that does not neccessarily mean that another person is also offended. when i do not like a video, or a book, or any other type of content, someone else should not have that content censorded because my opinion is in the way of what they enjoy. i know that personally i would not want someone to take away my favorite book so my child could not read it. content that is out in the public will always be unsafe to read by someone else's views. just like i will not believe in what other people believe in, but, i will see that it is valued by others and should not remain a censored topic.          books that are considered inappropriate, should be decided to has censoreship by the parents of a young child. decisions like that should not be left up to a group of people that has opposite views. whe children are growing up and are taught the values that know today, it is their parents that teach them and not a society full of people which have different kinds of opinions. there is a saying by an author and it says 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' and all that means if we all would have the power to remove a book or any other content from the shelf that we do not like then their would not be any books left. i believ in that saying and i also believe that many others will as well.      individualaity is when one person has differnt traits of feelings than another human being. we all have choices of the books we read and the musice we listen to and that is why we all have individuality. when people start to thnk that they are allowed to remove a certain song or book because that is not what they want other people to see, then everyone will do the same and no one would have that song they enjoy or the traits that make them differnt because they are the only one that likes that song. if there were not any of us left on this earth that has something that they enjoyed and no one else that also enjoyed the same thing, then we would all be pretty boring. i have learned from experience that being the person that has something different about them is not a bad thing and is actually a good thing in some cases.      also from experience i have learned that a boom that is no longer on the shelf that someone has removed is not a good feeling. i would not want the same happen to all of the other books in the world. it is a very good thing to practice the art of understading, and to have an open mind when it comes to a certain material that another person happens to enjoy. in the future, when i find a book that @month not be a book i would want my children to read, i will just let the topic go and remember that everyone has their own opinions. so in conclusion i just want to let everyone know that books that are seen as inappropriate or offensive to one person, @month be seen as a good thing to another.</td>\n",

'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self. but if i have the right to remove that book from the self that work i abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no book left on the self for any of us.' @caps quote from the arthur, katherine paterson, from my opinion, i believe that what she is saying is very true. considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the self, there would not be a varity of books for people to choose from. i have sometimes gotten corious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. they either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible. then i would read a few pages and i would think it was pretty good. so if they had the right to remove that book i would have never got the chance to read that book.     i do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelfs just on their specific personality. everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books. everyone should get a large variety</td>\n",

              "      <td>dear newspaper, i think people need computers. it helps them see the world if they cannot. it can be used to send important messages to people that are farther away from you. also if someone has a parent or loved one far away they can see each other through the computer. so here is examples of these three things. some people cannot physically or mentally and cannot afford to travel. its sad how some people are so sick with a disease or illness that they cannot go places. but if they go on the internet they can look up pictures and information of places they have never been to which can help them see the world better. but there are people who can help them see the world better. but there are people who have fears which prevent them from travelling to different places. so thet could go to the internet and find ways to help them get over their fears. which in turn will allow them to get over their fears and let them travel to places. then there are people who cannot afford it. so the internet can help find a good job that pays good money which they can use to afford to travel the world and see it for what it is. what if you need to send a really important message to someone to prevent them doing something or help them live or even stop a war. so take into reconsideration if there is a war going on for a miss understanding. so if the government figures out what happened and they know how to straightin out the situation then they could send a message to the attackers. what happened and that it was not what they thought we did then they would stop fighting and the war would be over. what if a bomb is in the white house you would want to get out of the building or find it and disarm it. so then a guy finds out about it and send a message to the white house and that would save all the people in the white houses lives. sometimes loved ones go away to some where far away and you cannot talk or see them. someones in the military and heshe has a kid so the computer allows them to see and talk to them through a webcam which would keep the child and parent together and not seperate them. also you see a friend in facebook who you have not seen in years so you friend him and you guys get back in touch with each other and you can be friends with them again. so in conclusion the computer can do many helpful things. it can fix relationships, save lives, help you get over fears and see the world. which is not bad sure we sometimes go over board with it but it is very useful. it is not horrible but it is sometimes bad but also sometimes good but</td>\n",

              "      <td>libraries are a great resource for information all around the world.  they contain many different styles and genres of books.  some might not be appropriate for young children to read.  there are people that debate whether or not some books are too offensive to be put up on library shelves.  i believe that no book should be denied of this right.  most children that go to a library already know what kind of book they want and are with an adult at all times.     most libraries have children sections.  offensive books are most likely found in the teenager or adults sections, not the children section.  so, to my defense, there could really be no way that a child would seek out these 'offensive' books anyway.  children today are exposed to more explicit topics, but i doubt they would want to read a book about them.     next, if a child goes up to the check out desk the librarian should be able to tell their parent or guardian that certain book is not suitable for that age of child.  going back to my point of children usually go to libraries with their guardians, they should be supervised at all times while in a library.  if an adult cares that much about what their child reads they can easily decide what is offensive or not.     finally, authors should not be punished for writing something they believe in or like.  they worked hard on writing and publishing their novels, they should be able to show them off.  if librarians do take off books for being offensive to some adults, a lot of books will be gone from the shelves.  the quote used for this essay explains this thought more thoroughly.  people should be able to read whatever they want, offensive or not.  children being able to do this? depends on the parent.      there is no way a child could check out an offensive book, take it home, and read it without their guardian knowing.  yes, all parents do not care about what their child reads, so this could happen.  just because some adults complained about books being too offensive for their children does not mean a revolt has to happen.  those parents should just step up and be more strict about what their child can and cannot read.  some of the most 'offensive' books out there are the very best to read.</td>\n",

              "      <td>libraries have always been an outstanding source for information. among the myriad of resourceful materials provided by libraries are book, movies, and magazines. recently, the debate over whether libraries should censor offensive materials has caused quite a stir. many parents argue that they do not want their children to be exposed to explicit materials, especially books, exhibited in public libraries. others have retorted to this statement by saying that if every book that is viewed as offensive is taken off the shelves, the shelves would be nearly empty. author katherine paterson stated,      ' all of us can think of  book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelfthat work i abhorthen you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' katherine paterson. books that are offensive should not be removed from libraries for the simple reason that they are still one of the most reliable sources for information and historical events, and, without books, society would suffer.     the most important reason as to why people should not be allowed to remove offensive books from shelves is that if every person was allowed to remove a book that heshe found offensive, there would not be many books remaining on the libraries' shelves. there are many historical works that contain offensive images and content, but people have to overlook this because these books are accounts of our history. without them, society would forget about the past events that shaped and molded our world into the world it is today.      another  important reason why library censhorship is wrong is that material that one person @month find to be offensive @month not be ofensive to another. every person has hisher own view on certain matters and events. for this reason, the censorship of a certain book should not come down to the opinion of one individual. rather, the decision to take a certain book off of library shelves should come from the opinions of a large group of individuals. by doing so, a fair representation of      @caps, most books are meant to tell either fictional stories  or historical events that are not meant to offend anyone. fictional books are meant to fill the mind of whoever reads them with tales and mental images of a story created by the author. also, historical books are meant to capture the events of our past so that people @month be able to look back on these events both now and in the future.        in all, the idea of censoring libraries is a negative proposal. books were meant to provide historical accounts and fictional stories to enrigh the minds of readers, not poison them with bad content. everyone has their own views, which is why people should learn to respect the views of different books no matter how offensive the material @month be to them</td>\n",

              "      <td>i can think of several books that, i would not want a child of mine to pick up and read. i as soon as i seen what i was going to be writing about this one flashed in my head like lighting. the book that @caps choosing is called '@caps @caps @caps.'      the book '@caps @caps @caps' is about a young girl that grew up without a father. her mother never wanted to talk about him because, she knew that this way only going to make matters worse. the young girl grew up with the dream of being daddy's little girl.that is all she wanted out of life. she sit and thought is that just a little to much to ask for.      after a few years, had passed by she had finally got the nerve to go on a hunt for father. she went by herself, leaving her mother behind.her mother always pumped in the head that her father was up to no good. that she would be better off without him there. but, she went on the hunt of her father by faith in the lord.      after saying many prayers to the lord, she finally thought that.she just @month knew what this hunt was going to take. so she went to her @caps, hoping that she @month just have the anwsers. that she needed to solve her heartace and pain. that she could just walk @caps knowing that somewhere out there in the world that her father would be waiting for her.       it is was just before the sun was beginning to sit, when she noticed a little old southern bell. sitting out on the front porch in a wooden rocking chair. she went up to her @caps and kissed her on the forehead,with tears filled in her eyes.her @caps said 'now dear why must you be crying.' @caps, with the lump in the throat she asked  wouldo you know where i @month find my father?' @caps answered with yes! dear, @caps's laying down in his bed. that is when her face began to glow.     she went in the old cottage to find her father lying on the bed writing her. she was nervous but with the help of her @caps she sit and talked with her father.her father told her that her had wrote her a letter everyday.that is @num letters a year. she told her father that i have never recieved a letter from you in my entire life span. that is when it clicked to her that @month be why her mother never let her check the mail.     after @num years had passed by she finally found her father. truth was that her father @caps out of his daughters life because, the mother did not want him to be a part of her life. she did whatever it took to keep them apart, even if that meant going aganist law orders. father explained that her mother needed her there to look after her because, her was into some heavy drugs at the time. back then there was nothing @caps could do to take his daughter @caps from her mother.      the reason i choose this book was because, when i was young my father did the same to me. @caps left me and i have never had the chance to get to know my family. the pain of growing up without either mom nor dad is tuff. you cry many tears and try to patch up the holes in you heart. sometime's the bleed still seemeds to find it is way through. after reading the book i always wondered why they called her she. they called her she because, she took the blame for her father walking out of her life.      many children are growing up without mom or dad. there's a higher percentange of single parent family's now days than before.just like in the book most kids take the blame for a parnet not being there. if i could take that book off the shelf, then i would because, no child needs to be reminded of the pain they went through.would you do the same if you were looking out for your child?      all these children want is to know there loved and that someone cares about them.if your going to have these types of books then there needs to be a form for the parnets to fill out giving permission. if they are over age then that is total fine. they are at the age where they should be able to handle it, than going through these feeling alone</td>\n",

              "      <td>censorship is one of many important issues facing the world today.  many argue that materials considered offensive are damaging to society, and should not be tolerated.  others believe that freedom of speech is a universal right that should extend to any and all forms of human expression.  the issue is further complicated by the concept of what is and is not appropriate for children.  are there materials that are acceptable for adults, but not kids?  questions such as this have plagued humanity for hundreds of years, and there is no simple solution.       today, so many people think of censorship as a bad word.  in fact, there is nothin inherently wrong with the concept of censorship.  it is only when people begin to abuse their power and censor materials that should not be censored that problems arise.  for example, many countries have restrictions on selling and owning copies of '@person,' the book that @person wrote as a sort of mission statement for @location.  while many of the ideas contained within the book are horribly offensive, it still should not be censored.  people have the right to read the book and form their own opinions on @persongs teachings, it is not the government's place to decide for them.  while oppressive dictatorship and massmurder are crimes, reading about them is not.     there are few materials available that should rightfully be censored and taken out of adult hands.  if someone understands what they are reading, and are able to form an educated opinion on the material, then nobody has the right to stop them from expanding their knowledge, or expressing themself by creating similar material.  however, the issue changes completely when one considers children.  if adults want to view pornography, or read accounts of extreme violence, that is their business.  however, those concepts are obviously inappropriate for children, and any decent parent would not want their young kids filling their heads with such things.  children need to be slowly and gently introduced to these concepts so they can fully understand them.  in the case of children, careful censorship is necessary for healthy development.       when it comes to libraries, there are very few materials that should be banned.  if libraries are meant to be places of learning, then one has no right to limit the information they contain.  however, that does not mean there should not be any limitations.  libraries should offer a childrengs section, as many do, that would contain materials only appropriate for youngsters.  then, it becomes the parents' responsibilty to ensure that their child stays in that section.  when a parent believes the child is ready to explore the adult section, they are free to take their kid there.  this system gives parents the ability to keep their children away from harmful material, without taking it out of the hands of adults.  many would argue that unsupervised children could gain access to inappropriate material, but that is really an issue that needs to be handled by parents, not the library.  after all, it is better that a few kids see something they should not have than all adults have to read censored material.       in conclusion, censorship is a concept that has its place in society, but must be used very carefully.  when the goal is to protect people, especially children, from harmful material, it can be used sparingly.  however, when those in power use censorship to attack ideas they disagree with, it becomes a form of oppression.  above all else, people must be free to educate themselves, form their own opinions, and express themselves.  if someone does not like a piece of material, they can leave it alone, but they should never try to take it out of someone else's hands</td>\n",
